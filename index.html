            <p>Running a small business requires financial flexibility, but sometimes cash flow can get in the way. It’s
              a
              scenario that every small business has encountered: Your business has equity, but you’ve encountered a gap
              in funding
              that’s slowing your progress. Maybe you’ve hit a delay in profits. Maybe you’re looking to buy a
              significant amount
              of product at a discount. Maybe an unforeseen repair needs to be made. Taking out a loan is an option that
              makes a lot of
              sense, but how will you assess interest fees, payment plans, and amounts? How can you find a financial
              partner that
              you trust?</p>
            <h3 class="text-blue">Don't miss your next big opportunity because you don't have access to the funds you
              need, and don't jump through hoops when you don’t need to.</h3>

                    we will
                    waive the remaining interest on that loan. This can save you up to 7% interest.</p>
